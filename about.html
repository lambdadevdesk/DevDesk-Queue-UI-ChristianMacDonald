                    <p>
                        Dev Desk Queue was developed by a group of students at Lambda School during a build week, in which
                        a team of students from different points in the course are paired together for the purposes of
                        getting the students used to collaborating with people with whom they may not be familiar. The
                        purpose of this application is to make a ticket system that would allow suggestions to be made and
                        issues to be raised in an easier and more efficient way. Although only one UI design was used for
                        the final version of the application, all three UI developers contributed their own designs for
                        consideration.
